          <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
          <p class="description">
            Hello! I’m Anna Thompson, a student at <a href="https://www.colostate.edu" target="_blank">Colorado State University</a> (CSU) studying <strong>Computer Science</strong>. 
            Throughout my time at CSU, I've worked on several projects, developing my technical skills and collaborating closely with peers to learn the software engineering process. 
            These experiences have strengthened my ability to communicate, problem-solve, and adapt in dynamic environments.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            Over the summer of 2024, I interned at <a href="https://www.sncorp.com" target="_blank">Sierra Nevada Corporation</a> (SNC) as a <strong>Tech Systems Intern</strong>, where I gained hands-on experience in software engineering. 
            From a young age, I always wanted to be a pilot, but later found my skills and way of thinking was better suited for computer science. 
            After graduation, I plan to join SNC as a <strong>Software Engineer I</strong>, and I’m so excited that I’m beginning my career with a company that combines my interests and will allow me to make a meaningful impact with my work!

          <h1 class="subtitle">My Interests</h1>
          <p class="description">
            Beyond software engineering, I have many interests that keep me inspired and constantly learning.
            I enjoy <strong>digital art</strong>, where I’m able to express myself more creatively. I specifically enjoy creating landscape paintings!
            I love being outside, whether that be <strong>hiking</strong> and <strong>kayaking</strong> in the summer, or <strong>skiing</strong> in the winter!
            I’m also an <strong>avid reader</strong>, and I’m always looking to learn something new!
