          <h1 class="subtitle">Electrical Engineering Calculator</h1>
          <p class="description">
            During my internship at Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), I developed an application that performs a variety of electrical engineering calculations using <strong>C# and the .NET framework</strong>. 
            This tool was designed to solve complex calculations commonly used by electrical engineers at SNC, making these calculations much more efficient to perform and do all in one place. 
            The application featured a <strong>user-friendly interface</strong> with dropdowns, input fields, and validation to ensure accurate data entry. 
            My role included not only coding the calculations but also designing the UI, implementing data validation, and ensuring the tool’s reliability by writing unit tests for each calculation.

          <h1 class="subtitle">Online Chess Platform</h1>
          <p class="description">
            As part of a team project for my Object-Oriented Design course at Colorado State University (CSU), we are developing an <strong>online chess platform</strong> where players can create unique profiles, challenge opponents, and engage in turn-based, asynchronous matches. 
            This project is mostly focused on designing our system based on established design patterns and strategies to produce a maintainable and scalable system. 
            This project involved the use of <strong>Java</strong> for backend development, and <strong>JavaScript and React</strong> for our frontend.

          <p class="description">
            As part of a team project for my Software Engineering course at CSU, we designed and developed a trip planner application focused on <strong>optimizing travel routes</strong>. 
            The application enabled users to select multiple destinations on a map and, using an algorithm, calculated the most efficient route to visit each location. 
            The application also enabled users to search for specific airports by name or find nearby airports based on provided coordinates, using a <strong>comprehensive database</strong> of known airports.

          <p class="description">
            As part of my Exploring Virtual Worlds course, I designed and developed a <strong>fast-paced cooking game</strong> built in <strong><a href="https://unity.com" target="_blank">Unity</a></strong>, inspired by the game Overcooked! 
            The gameplay focuses on speed, coordination, and precision, requiring players to chop ingredients, cook dishes, and deliver orders accurately to meet the demands of customers.

          <h1 class="subtitle">Raspberry Pi Home Security System</h1>
          <p class="description">
            At CSU in my Operating Systems course, I led a team to develop a <strong>home security system</strong> using a Raspberry Pi. 
            We designed a program using <strong>Python</strong> that uses a camera module to detect and log faces when they enter the frame. 
            To achieve this, we implemented the <strong><a href="https://opencv.org" target="_blank">OpenCV library</a></strong>, using its <strong>computer vision and machine learning</strong> capabilities to identify faces. 
            This made our system efficient for real-time security monitoring.
